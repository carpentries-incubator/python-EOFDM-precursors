# Using Python to detect EOFDM Precursors within flight data

Flight data analysis to detect features relevant to the continual improvement of safety.

This lesson introduces the European Flight Data Monitoring Forum [EOFDM](https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/safety-management/safety-promotion/european-operators-flight-data-monitoring-eofdm-forum) and their list of precursors to in flight events. 

Working group B of the forum created a [pseudocode guide](https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/study_wgb_precursors_rev3_20200930_4.pdf) for detecting the agreed precursors. 

Through several worked examples we will examine different ways to implement some of these algorithms in python and enable discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
